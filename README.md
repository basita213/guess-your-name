# Guess Your Name

A simple Python script that asks for the user's favorite color and name, then prints the name.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (Make sure Python is installed on your system)

## Running the Compiled `.pyc` File

1. To run the compiled `.pyc` file from the repository, use the following command:
    ```bash
    python <repertoire_path>/GuessName.cpython-312.pyc
    ```
   Replace `<repertoire_path>` with the full path to the `.pyc` file in your system (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\path\to\file`).
